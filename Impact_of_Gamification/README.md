PROJECT INFORMATION: The original project was submitted as my dissertation for my Master's study. For the purpose of this portfolio, the original formatting and some of the contents have been removed. For full study and project content, contact me via the email address provided in the 'README' file for the repository.

TOOLS USED: Microsoft Forms, Microsoft Excel, R programming language, XAMPP (running the MOODLE Server), Microsoft Azure Virtual Machine.

The dataset, R code and Questionnaire can be found in the 'appendices' folder.

The 'dataset' is the excel file

The 'R code' is code used to generate some of the charts in R programming language.

The 'Questionnaire' was sent to the participants using Microsoft Forms, to obtain data for the project.

The full dataset information, participant information, diagrams and analysis are contained in the 'Impact_of_Gamification_github.pdf' file.
