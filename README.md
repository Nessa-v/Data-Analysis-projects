Welcome to my data analysis portfolio!  

This repository contains a collection of projects where I explored datasets using MS Excel, Python, PostgreSQL, and Orange Data Mining.

Projects:

1. Sales Data Analysis: Conducted end-to-end analysis of Superstore sales data using SQL and Python to uncover trends in product performance, discount impact, regional sales, and profitability (Python, PostgreSQL).
   
2. Gamified Moodle Platform: Developed a gamified web app to tackle the issue of low student engagement in higher education (Microsoft Forms, Microsoft Excel, MOODLE LMS).
   
3. Netflix Movies Dataset Analysis: Statistically analysed 1990s movies from Netflix’s data, through data cleaning, exploration, and visualising trends (Python).
   
4. Carbon Footprint SQL Analysis: Analysed a carbon emissions data in SQL to identify high-emission companies and products (PostgreSQL).
   
5. Credit Card Default Prediction: Built and evaluated ML models (Logistic Regression, SVMs, Neural Networks, etc.), to predict credit card default using a bank’s data (Microsoft Excel, Orange Data Mining, Python).
   
6. Pet Supplies Analysis: Analysed data to identify missing values, explore relationships, visualise repeat purchases, and explore their impact on revenue (Microsoft Excel).
