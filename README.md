Welcome to my data analysis portfolio!  

This repository contains a collection of projects where I cleaned, explored and analysed datasets. I also extracted key insights and provided suitable solutions using MS Excel, Python, PostgreSQL, R and Orange Data Mining. 

The tools I am most comfortable with are MS Excel and PostgreSQL.

As I continue to learn and grow in data analytics, I will make changes to this repository where necessary.

Projects:

1. Sales Data Analysis: Conducted end-to-end analysis of Superstore sales data using SQL and Python to uncover trends in product performance, discount impact, regional sales, and profitability (Python, PostgreSQL).
   
2. Gamified Moodle Platform: Developed a gamified web app to tackle the issue of low student engagement in higher education (Microsoft Forms, Microsoft Excel, MOODLE LMS).
   
3. Netflix Movies Dataset Analysis: Statistically analysed 1990s movies from Netflix’s data, through data cleaning, exploration, and visualising trends (Python).
   
4. Carbon Footprint SQL Analysis: Analysed a carbon emissions data in SQL to identify high-emission companies and products (PostgreSQL).
   
5. Pet Supplies Analysis: Analysed data to identify missing values, explore relationships, visualise repeat purchases, and explore their impact on revenue (Microsoft Excel). 

## More projects will be added to this repository soon...
