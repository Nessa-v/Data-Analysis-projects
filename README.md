I am a data analyst, always excited to wrangle messy data, uncover trends & patterns and storytell to convey its information.

### Welcome to my data analysis portfolio!  

This repository contains a collection of projects where I cleaned, explored and analysed datasets. I've also extracted key insights and provided suitable solutions using MS Excel, Python, PostgreSQL, and AI.
The tools I am most comfortable with are MS Excel and PostgreSQL.

As I continue to learn and grow in data analytics, I will make changes to this repository where necessary.

#### More projects will be added to this repository soon...
