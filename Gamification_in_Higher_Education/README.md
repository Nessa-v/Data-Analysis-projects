# PROJECT TITLE: Gamification in Higher Education and Analysis using Moodle LMS.

This project investigated:

a. contrary to research, gamification DOES NOT improve student engagement and IS NOT effective in higher education.

b. similar to research, gamification DOES improve student engagement and IS effective in higher education.
 
The project combines real feedback, platform screenshots, and structured data analysis using Excel and Power Query.

## 🔍 Background

This project was inspired by a lecture where I noticed that I and many of my coursemates were disengaged. The course was not our major and it seemed very abstract, so I wondered if it was possible to turn the lecture into a relatable game.

After experimenting with platforms like Kahoot!, Duolingo, Classcraft, etc., I built a custom gamified course on Moodle LMS hosted on an Azure VM. I split a usability engineering course into six modules: four gamified and two non-gamified. I created multiple-choice and short-answer questions using the 'Aiken' and 'GIFT' question format in Moodle respectively. Participants engaged with the platform and submitted their feedback (both quantitative and qualitative) through a structured questionnaire, devlivered through a Microsoft form link.

## 📊 Key Insights from Analysis

### 🎮 Gamification Experience & Impact
- 96.7% of participants said gamification improved their understanding.
- 93.3% of participants reported being either satisfied or very satisfied.
- Average engagement level was 4.4 out of 5, indicating high engagement.
- The most liked gamification element was “Level Up XP”, indicating that participants liked the idea of competition and winning (being at the top of the leaderboard) while learning. Other frequently selected elements include stash items, custom avatars, crossword and find the words. Participants were allowed to select multiple elements.

### 👥 Demographic Insights
- Majority of participants came from IT/Computing backgrounds.
- The most engaged group was 18–24-year-olds, followed by those aged 45–50.
- Both male and female participants showed comparable/nearly identical satisfaction and engagement levels.

### 🔁 Engagement vs Understanding & Prior Knowledge
- Even participants with no prior gamification knowledge reported high engagement (avg 4.3/5) and improved understanding.
- Understanding improved across all engagement levels, but was most consistent among those scoring 4 or 5 on the engagement scale.

### 🧠 Opinions on Gamification
- Top opinions recorded were: Engaging, Fun, Rewarding, and Innovative.
- Many participants appreciated the interactivity, progression, and feedback mechanisms built into the gamified platform.

### 🧩 Element Preference & Reasoning
- Users chose elements like Level Up XP, stash items, Crossword and Find the words for reasons such as:
  - “Interesting”
  - “Progression”
  - “Enjoyable”
- These preferences reflect a strong inclination toward game mechanics that reward progress, exploration and critical thinking.
