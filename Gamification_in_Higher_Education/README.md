# PROJECT TITLE: Gamification in Higher Education and Analysis using Moodle LMS.

This project investigates:

a. contrary to research, gamification DOES NOT improve student engagement and IS NOT effective in higher education.

b. similar to research, gamification DOES improve student engagement and IS effective in higher education.
 
The project combines real feedback, platform screenshots, and structured data analysis using Excel and Power Query.

## 🔍 Background

This project was inspired by a lecture where I — and many of my classmates — were disengaged. I started wondering: *Could learning feel more like a game?*

After experimenting with platforms like Kahoot!, Duolingo, and FoldIt, I built a custom gamified course on Moodle LMS hosted on an Azure VM. I split a usability engineering course into six modules: four gamified and two non-gamified. I create multiple-choice and short-answer questions using the 'Aiken' and 'GIFT' question format in Moodle respectively. Participants engaged with the platform and submitted their feedback (both quantitative and qualitative) through a structured questionnaire, devlivered through a Microsoft form link.

## 📊 Key Insights from Analysis

### 🎮 Gamification Experience & Impact
- 96.7% of participants said gamification improved their understanding.
- 93.3% of participants reported being either satisfied or very satisfied.
- Average engagement level was 4.4 out of 5, indicating high interaction.
- The most liked gamification element was “Level Up XP”, followed by Custom Avatars and Snakes and Ladders.

### 🧠 Opinions on Gamification
- Top descriptors used were: Engaging, Fun, Rewarding, and Innovative.
- Many participants appreciated the interactivity, progression, and feedback mechanisms built into the gamified platform.

### 👥 Demographic Insights
- Majority of participants came from IT/Computing backgrounds.
- The most engaged group was 18–24-year-olds, followed by those aged 45–50.
- Both male and female participants showed comparable satisfaction and engagement levels.

### 🧩 Element Preference & Reasoning
- Users chose elements like Level Up XP, Crossword, and Cryptex for reasons such as:
  - “Interesting”
  - “Progression”
  - “Enjoyable”
- These preferences reflect a strong inclination toward game mechanics that reward progress and critical thinking.

### ⚠️ Challenges Reported
- The vast majority reported no challenges.
- A small number (3 participants) mentioned Navigation as a usability issue.

### 💬 Suggestions from Participants
- Key themes in suggestions:
  - Easier Navigation
  - Improved UI
  - Optional leaderboard features
- These responses suggest minor usability adjustments rather than core concept issues.

### 🔁 Engagement vs Understanding & Prior Knowledge
- Even participants with no prior gamification knowledge reported high engagement (avg 4.3/5) and improved understanding.
- Understanding improved across all engagement levels, but was most consistent among those scoring 4 or 5 on the engagement scale.


#####  GENERAL DASHBOARD IMAGE WITH KPI IMAGE #######


## 🔄 Comparative Insights

- Participants aged 18–24 had the highest engagement levels
- Both genders showed nearly identical satisfaction scores
- Users with no prior gamification experience still reported high understanding
- “Fun” and “Interactive” were the most frequent opinion tags
